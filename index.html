FOCUS AREAS                 

At Buberry Worldwide, we focus on the following areas to 
promote regenerative agroforestry and sustainable 
development. Learn more about each of these areas below. 
    
    
CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION
-------------------------

Climate change poses a significant threat to
global food security and environmental sustainability.
We work to develop and promote regenerative
agroforestry practices that build resilience to
climate change, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions,
and enhance carbon sequestration.


EDUCATION AND TRAINING
----------------------

We believe that education and training are key to building
capacity for sustainable development. We offer a range of
courses and resources on regenerative agroforestry,
sustainability, and related topics through our Moodle
learning management system (LMS).


SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY
--------------------------

Regenerative agroforestry has the potential to promote social
justice and equity by providing livelihood opportunities to
marginalized communities, promoting gender equality, and
strengthening community resilience. We work to ensure that
our projects and initiatives are inclusive and equitable.


ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION
----------------------

Degradation of ecosystems is a major threat to biodiversity
and human well-being. We work to restore degraded ecosystems
through regenerative agroforestry practices that promote
biodiversity conservation, soil health, and ecosystem
services.


RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
------------------------

We are committed to advancing the science and practice of
regenerative agroforestry through research and innovation.
We collaborate with researchers and practitioners around
the world to develop and test new techniques, technologies,
and approaches to sustainable development.

OUR PLATFORMS                 
   
At Buberry Worldwide, we leverage technology to connect 
people, data, and knowledge to drive real-world action 
toward regenerative agroforestry and sustainable 
development. Learn more about our platforms below. 

MAPPING AND DATA COLLECTION PLATFORM
-------------------------------------
Our mapping and data collection platform enables us to 
collect and analyze data on regenerative agroforestry 
systems and measure their impact. The platform allows users 
to visualize data on maps, collect data using mobile devices 
and sensors, and analyze data using a range of tools and 
technologies. 

MOODLE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (LMS)
---------------------------------------
Our Moodle LMS platform offers a range of courses and 
resources to support education and training on agroforestry, 
sustainability, and more. The platform features interactive 
learning materials, quizzes and assessments, discussion 
forums, and other tools to support learner engagement and 
knowledge retention. 

USHAHIDI CROWDSOURCING PLATFORM
-------------------------------
Our Ushahidi platform enables crowdsourcing of information 
and feedback from stakeholders involved in regenerative 
agroforestry projects. The platform allows users to report 
observations, share feedback, and contribute to decision-making 
related to project planning, implementation, and monitoring 
and evaluation. 

BLOCKCHAIN-BASED TRACEABILITY PLATFORM
--------------------------------------
Our blockchain-based traceability platform enables 
transparency and traceability in supply chains related to 
regenerative agroforestry products. The platform uses 
distributed ledger technology to provide secure, tamper-proof 
records of product origin, production, and distribution, 
enabling consumers to make informed choices about the products 
they buy and their impact on the environment and society. 

REMOTE SENSING AND ANALYTICS PLATFORM
-------------------------------------
Our remote sensing and analytics platform leverages satellite 
imagery, machine learning, and other technologies to monitor 
and analyze environmental and land-use changes related to 
regenerative agroforestry systems. The platform provides 
timely and accurate information on ecosystem health, land-use 
change, and other key indicators to support decision-making 
and planning related to sustainable development.

<div id="ushahidi" class="hidden">

Ushahidi Platform for Resource Managemen
Ushahidi is a powerful platform that allows us to
capture and visualize data related to our local
environment. With it, we are creating an interactive
resource management network to support localized food
production and capture, while providing locations of
community events and spaces.

One of our primary uses of Ushahidi is to capture
the locations of trees, along with data related to
their health, harvest times, and ecological value.
This helps us track pest damage and make informed
decisions about resource management.

Our network of data helps us make better decisions
about how to manage our local resources, improving
our ability to provide for our community and protect
our environment.
